## 1. Basic Queries  

These queries involve fundamental SQL operations:

- **Counting Records**:  
  Use `COUNT()` to determine the number of rows in a table.  

- **Alphabetizing Results**:  
  Use `ORDER BY` to sort results in ascending or descending order.  

- **Filtering Data**:  
  Use the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on specific conditions.  

- **Limiting Results**:  
  Use `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned.

## 2. Data Aggregation  

These queries demonstrate how to summarize and group data:

- **Calculating Duration**:  
  Identify records with the maximum or minimum values.  

- **Grouping Data**:  
  Use `GROUP BY` to aggregate data by a specific column.  

- **Applying Conditions to Aggregates**:  
  Use `HAVING` to filter grouped results.  

- **Date Calculations**:  
  Calculate the difference between two dates using `DATEDIFF()`.

## 3. Joins and Relationships  

These queries explore relationships between tables:

- **Inner and Outer Joins**:  
  Combine data from multiple tables using `JOIN`.  

- **Counting Related Records**:  
  Find the number of related entries, such as tracks in playlists or invoices per country.  

- **Identifying Top Records**:  
  Use `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` to find records with the highest values.

## 4. Conditional Queries  

These queries involve conditional logic and categorization:

- **Pattern Matching**:  
  Use `LIKE` with wildcards (`%`, `_`) to search for specific text patterns.  

- **Case Statements**:  
  Categorize records based on conditions using `CASE`.  

- **Combining Conditions**:  
  Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) to filter data with complex conditions.

## 5. Advanced Queries  

These queries include complex logic and advanced SQL techniques:

- **Multiple Joins**:  
  Combine data from several tables to extract insights.  

- **Sales Analysis**:  
  Summarize and filter sales data based on conditions.  

- **Track and Genre Analysis**:  
  Analyze tracks and genres, categorizing results based on calculated values.  

- **Custom Rankings**:  
  Use aggregation and ordering to identify top-performing entries.
